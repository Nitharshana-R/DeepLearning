Imports:

numpy as np: Imports the NumPy library for numerical computations.
pandas as pd: Imports the Pandas library for data manipulation.
Functions from sklearn: Imports functions for data splitting (model_selection.train_test_split), data preprocessing (sklearn.preprocessing), and missing value imputation (sklearn.impute).

Class NeuralNet:

init(self, train, header = True, h1 = 4, h2 = 2):
Initializes the neural network with training data (train), optional header information (header), and the number of nodes in the first (h1) and second (h2) hidden layers.
Splits the training data into training and testing sets using model_selection.train_test_split.
Extracts features and labels from the training data.
Defines the number of input and output layers based on the data.
Initializes weights for connections between layers using random values.

__activation(self, x, activation="sigmoid"):

Defines the activation function used in the network. Currently supports sigmoid (sigmoid), but needs implementation for tanh and ReLU.
Takes input x and the activation function type as arguments.
Returns the activation function applied to the input.

__activation_derivative(self, x, activation="sigmoid"):

Similar to __activation, but calculates the derivative of the activation function.
__sigmoid(self, x):

Defines the sigmoid activation function.
__tanh(self,x): and __ReLu(self,x): 

Placeholder functions for defining tanh and ReLU activation functions.
__sigmoid_derivative(self, x):

Defines the derivative of the sigmoid function.
__tanh_derivative(self,x): and __ReLu_derivative(self,x):

Placeholder functions for defining derivatives of tanh and ReLU.
preprocess(self, X):

Needs implementation for data preprocessing tasks like scaling, normalization, and handling categorical data.
Currently includes label encoding, missing value imputation using mean strategy, and MinMax scaling for normalization.

train(self, activation, max_iterations = 1000, learning_rate = 0.05):

Trains the neural network with the specified activation function (activation), number of iterations (max_iterations), and learning rate (learning_rate).
Performs forward pass to calculate predictions.
Calculates the error between predictions and actual labels.
Performs backward pass to update weights based on the error.
Prints the total error after training and the final weight vectors.

forward_pass(self, activation):

Performs a forward pass through the network, calculating activations for each layer.

backward_pass(self, out, activation):

Performs a backward pass through the network, calculating deltas (errors) for each layer.
Calls functions to compute deltas for output, hidden layers 2 and 1.

compute_output_delta(self, out, activation="sigmoid"):

Calculates the delta for the output layer based on the chosen activation function.
compute_hidden_layer2_delta(self, activation="sigmoid"): and compute_hidden_layer1_delta(self, activation="sigmoid"):


Placeholder functions for calculating deltas for hidden layers 2 and 1 with different activation functions.
compute_input_layer_delta(self, activation="sigmoid"): 

Placeholder function for calculating delta for the input layer.

predict(self,activation="sigmoid", header = True):

Predicts on the test dataset using the trained model and specified activation function.
Preprocesses the test data.
Performs forward pass to get predictions.
Calculates the test error and prints it.
Returns the test error.

Main block:

Defines the dataset URL (dataset).
Creates three instances of NeuralNet for training with sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU activations.
Trains each network and calls.
